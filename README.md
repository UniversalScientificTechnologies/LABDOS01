# SPACEDOS03

SPACEDOS03A is an open-source spectrometer-dosimeter based on silicone PIN diode and is intended for scientific and research purposes. Power and communication is secured by USB port. The device can be used statically (located in a specific place) or in mobile applications (such as cars). The spectrograph is housed in an aluminum box that secures mechanical resistance. 

SPACEDOS03A is not able to function on its own. It does not contain any internal datalogger. It requires a computer to log/visualize the measured data.

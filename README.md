# SPACEDOS03

SPACEDOS03A is an open-source spectrometer-dosimeter based on silicone PIN diode and is intended for scientific and research purposes. Power and communication is secured by USB port. The device can be used statically (located in a specific place) or in mobile applications (such as cars). The spectrograph is housed in an aluminum box that secures mechanical resistance. 

SPACEDOS03A is not able to function on its own. It does not contain any internal datalogger. It requires a computer to log/visualize the measured data.

If you need a fully automatic device (with internal logging, backup power supply, ..) or device designed for outdoor use without the possibility of connecting power and network you can look at [GEODOS01](https://github.com/UniversalScientificTechnologies/GEODOS01) or contact us by email [support@ust.cz](mailto:support@ust.cz). We can agree on the development of equipment according to your requirements.
